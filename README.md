# block-travel

_**Note that [VSC now has similar functionality built-in](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/114166)!**_

Navigate documents, jumping by paragraph! Jumps up or down to nearest all-whitespace line.

Inspired by [Atom Block Travel](https://atom.io/packages/block-travel).

## Features

The following commands and corresponding default keybindings are provided:
```
block-travel.jumpUp: alt+up
block-travel.selectUp: alt+shift+up
block-travel.jumpDown: alt+down
block-travel.selectDown: alt+shift+down
